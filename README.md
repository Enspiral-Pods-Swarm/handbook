## **People, Pods & Purpose - Manifesto**



**Shared purpose is developed and refined on a 6-monthly basis by ecosystem participants using Systems mapping, finding shared values and recognising external forces**

**  
Intra-pod**

* **Pods are designed to offer security and promote personal and professional support to their members**

* **Pods distribute risk and reward internally and work to achieve financial and temporal abundance**

* **The ecosystem addresses systemic issues by developing interdependence and harnessing a diverse set of perspectives and expertise**

* **Pods collaborate on shared products and services according to ability, opportunity and need.**



**Extra-pod**

* **Systemic impact in a specific area of focus \(?\)**



## **Principles**



1. **Pods provide security to member-owners and award risk and return by agreement of their members**

2. **Pods work and collaborate on products and projects with preference for working with each other over third parties \(where feasible and viable\)**

3. **Pods proactively communicate internally and within the ecosystem**

4. **Pods share their learning with full transparency**

5. **Pods work for greater transparency with their finances**

6. **Pods coordinate protocols and resources in order to minimise communication and operational costs**



## **Protocols**



**In order to leverage organisational resources, collaborate around common goals, and avoid duplication of efforts  
**

1. **Pods identify and coordinate work that is already happening**

2. **Assign and coordinate rolesthat benefit the collective health of the whole**

3. **Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the network andcultivate a diversity of people, skills and perspectives**



**EXAMPLE - Product**

1. **GIVEN that a product has resources AND there are product tasks issued by a product Owner**
